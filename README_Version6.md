## 🚀 Project Overview

**SmartSumm** is a research project comparing the performance of state-of-the-art abstractive summarization models (**BART**, **T5**) with the traditional extractive method **TextRank**. Using the XSum news dataset, the project evaluates the accuracy and efficiency of modern models for automatic text summarization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Summarizing long content is crucial in domains such as news, medicine, and education. This project addresses the question:

> "Do Transformer-based models truly outperform traditional approaches for text summarization?"

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ Utilizes pre-trained models from Hugging Face: `facebook/bart-large-xsum`, `t5-base`
- 📰 Summarizes 50 real news articles
- 📊 Compares performance using ROUGE scores
- 📈 Visualizes differences between models
- 🗂️ Saves all results in a structured CSV file

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets (XSum)
- Sumy, NLTK
- Matplotlib, pandas

---

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets rouge-score sumy nltk matplotlib pandas
   ```
3. Download the `xsum.csv` data file and place it in the correct directory.
4. Run the script or the provided notebook.

## 📊 Results

| Model     | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **BART**      | 0.4821  | 0.2541  | 0.4075  |
| **T5**        | 0.1975  | 0.0366  | 0.1425  |
| **TextRank**  | 0.1633  | 0.0276  | 0.1107  |

> **BART significantly outperforms both T5 and TextRank across all ROUGE metrics, demonstrating the power of transformer-based abstractive summarization on news data.**
